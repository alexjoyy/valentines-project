            <h3>When we first met</h3>
            <p>
              When I first saw you in DLF ki parking, I knew instantly something about you was different. I thought, “yeh toh barbaad karegi,” and I knew I would happily be ruined by you. Since that day, you’ve made my life better and better with each passing day.

            <h3>Our first real laugh together</h3>
            <p>
              It was probably when I got bhand and started acting all clingy, but I couldn’t help it — you were just so cute.

              It’s like I need you 24/7. I’m seriously addicted to your silly self, but jokes apart, please don’t ever leave. I don’t know what I’d do without you.
